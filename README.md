## Mock E-commerce

A project made solely and exclusively for my portfolio and resume; therefore, any pull request will not be accepted since the mail goal here is for me to develop it all. Also, exact because it's a portfolio project, it has, of course, no real commercial purpose.

The website is built in Typescript, using the frameworks Next.js, React and TailwindCSS for front-end and Supabase and PostgreSQL for back-end.

## Running:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then open the adress [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
